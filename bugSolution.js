The solution typically involves carefully reviewing the project's `package.json` and `app.json` files.  Ensure that the specified React Native version in `package.json` aligns with the version supported by your Expo CLI version.  Any discrepancies might cause these unexpected token errors or build failures.  Consider running `expo prebuild` or `expo start --clear` to clear any existing build caches.  Updating your Expo CLI to the latest version using `npm install -g expo-cli` might resolve conflicts if the issue stems from compatibility problems.  If all else fails, creating a new project and gradually transferring code into it helps isolate whether the issue lies in a configuration file or a specific piece of code.
