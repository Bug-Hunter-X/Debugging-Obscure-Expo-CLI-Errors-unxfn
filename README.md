# Debugging Obscure Expo CLI Errors in Expo Projects

This repository demonstrates a common yet challenging scenario when working with the Expo CLI: encountering vague error messages during development.  These errors often lack specific details, making debugging difficult.  The example focuses on resolving unexpected token errors and unexplained build failures.  The core problem usually lies in inconsistencies among the project's configuration files (package.json, app.json) and the Expo CLI version.

## Problem

Expo CLI errors can sometimes be cryptic, particularly when the error message doesn't pinpoint the source directly. This example simulates such a situation, where a seemingly minor configuration issue results in build failures that aren't immediately apparent.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates how to systematically identify and resolve these obscure errors by:

* **Checking package.json:** Ensuring the React Native version specified here is compatible with the Expo CLI version.
* **Validating app.json:** Verifying that the configuration within app.json is valid and doesn't conflict with the rest of the project setup.
* **Updating Expo CLI:** Updating to the latest version of the Expo CLI can resolve compatibility issues with newer React Native versions or bug fixes.
* **Cleaning the project:** Clearing the cache and re-installing packages can sometimes resolve subtle issues.
