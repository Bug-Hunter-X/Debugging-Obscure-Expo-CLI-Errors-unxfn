This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project and often involves issues with the project's configuration, dependencies, or the Expo Go app itself.  The error messages are often vague, such as unexpected token errors or build failures without specific explanations. The root cause frequently lies in inconsistencies between the project's package.json, app.json, and the Expo CLI version used. For example, an incompatibility between the React Native version specified in package.json and the version implicitly used by Expo might lead to these obscure errors.
